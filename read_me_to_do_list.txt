The To-Do List Application is a simple task management tool built using Python and the tkinter library. This application helps users organize their daily tasks by providing functionality to add, update, delete, and clear tasks from the list in an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

Key Features

Add New Tasks
Users can add tasks by typing them into an input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
Once added, tasks are displayed in a list for easy management.
Update Existing Tasks

Users can select a task from the list, edit the task in the input field, and click the "Update Task" button to modify the task's details.
The selected task will be updated with the new information.
Delete Tasks

A task can be removed from the list by selecting it and clicking the "Delete Task" button.
This feature allows users to clear individual tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.
Clear All Tasks

Users can remove all tasks from the list at once by clicking the "Clear All Tasks" button, making it easy to start fresh after completing a to-do list.
User-Friendly Interface

Built with tkinter, the application provides a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate.
Buttons are clearly labeled for all main operations, and the listbox allows for easy selection and management of tasks.
